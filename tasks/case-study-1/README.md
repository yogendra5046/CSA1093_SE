# Case Study 1: Team Collaboration and Bug Fixing

## Scenario:
Your team is working on a simple calculator application. A bug has been reported where division by zero causes the application to crash.

## Objective:
- Fix the bug in a collaborative manner.
- Demonstrate effective use of branching and pull requests.

## Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the `calculator` directory.

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Create a branch named `fix/divide-by-zero`.

3. **Fix the Bug**:
   - Locate the bug in the `calculator.py` file.
   - Implement a solution to handle division by zero gracefully.

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Add and commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.

5. **Push and Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Push the branch to GitHub.
   - Create a pull request for the `main` branch and request a team review.

6. **Review and Merge**:
   - Another team member reviews the pull request, suggests changes if needed, and approves the merge.

## Deliverables:
- A pull request with the fix for the division by zero bug.
- A clean commit history and proper branch usage.

## Bonus Task:
Add a test case to `test_calculator.py` to ensure division by zero does not crash the application.
